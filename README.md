## Instructions
Recreate your favorite example of Swiss Design!


- [ ] Select an example from [swissted](https://www.swissted.com/) or [search for your own](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=swiss+design+examples&iax=images&ia=images) that speaks to you
- [ ] Fork this repository and clone it to your `critical-web-design` folder on your machine.
- [ ] Design
  - [ ] Open `designs/1.psd` in Gimp or Photoshop
  - [ ] Using only the Type and Shape tools, recreate the design you chose
  - [ ] Your layout should fit within the Bootstrap grid layout.
  - [ ] Save your document often
  - [ ] Make new versions as needed, naming them `2.psd`, `3.psd`, etc.
- [ ] HTML/CSS
  - [ ] Code your design inside `index.html`
  - [ ] Use only HTML and CSS to structure and style your design
  - [ ] Do not add images. Retype the text from the example you chose
  - [ ] Use the [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/) as well as custom CSS to create your design
  - [ ] Use CSS position, border, and translate() properties to create and rotate lines
  - [ ] Include a link to the image of the original design somewhere on the page.
  - [ ] Confirm your page uses valid [HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) (note filenames as Bootstrap CSS supports many old browsers so [will not validate](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/))
  - [ ] [Publish and post your project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17U_zmzM_eML_qkG0PaOdDRcEk3YEmbiQ1TyNnbAM08k/edit)
  - [ ] Refer to this [rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1daQKCtPQCRhu2RhqHZbqBKVeJP7OcyCypLadfn14zBA/edit) for grading.

## Design

1. Select an example of Swiss Design from [Swissted](https://www.swissted.com/) or [search for one](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=swiss+design+examples&iax=images&ia=images) that speaks to you
1. Recreate the design for desktop, tablet, and mobile.
    1. Use type, shape, pen, etc. tools in [Figma](https://figma.com) to recreate art in the design.
    1. Use a [layout grid for each device size](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040450513-Create-layout-grids-with-grids-columns-and-rows) in Figma.
    1. The parts of your layout that use columns should fit within the Bootstrap grid layout.
    1. Refer to course *Web Typography & Swiss Design* slides as needed.

## Code

1. Use HTML, CSS, [SVG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emFMHH2Bfvo), and JS to code your design inside `index.html`
1. For the column areas in the design
    1. Retype all text from the example you chose.
    1. Use the [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/) as well as custom CSS for the columns in your design
1. For the art in the design
    1. You may use SVGs to render the art in the poster but do not add raster image files.
    1. Use CSS `position`, `border`, and `translate()` properties to create and rotate lines
1. Add links to your design files
    1. Make the **band name** a link to the page of the original design
    1. Make the **show date** a link to your Figma layouts
	1. Check that the [`:active`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:active), [`:hover`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:hover), [`:link`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:link), and [`:visited`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:visited) pseudoclasses match the poster style
1. Use JS `console.log()` to show credits: the original author of the design, and yourself
1. Do not add any additional content (like the assignment name) to the page


## Before you submit

Check your project on your phone, as well as the responsive devices inside Chrome DevTools. For each breakpoint:

1. Does the design either exactly match the original, or somehow improve it (alterations to make it work at smaller sizes)
1. Can you read all the text at all breakpoints?
1. Are any text or graphic elements overlapping or awkward?



## Publish

1. [Save and refresh](https://github.com/omundy/learn-computing/blob/main/topics/keyboard-shortcuts.md#web-development-edit-save-refresh-loop) your work in the browser often to see your changes.
1. Commit changes regularly.
1. Confirm valid [HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) <sup>([?](https://github.com/omundy/dig245-critical-web-design/blob/main/topics/html-css/css.md#css-validation))</sup>
1. When finished, push, publish, and post all deliverables to Moodle per documentation in the Assignments.
